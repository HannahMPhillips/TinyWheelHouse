# TinyWheelHouse
This is a tiny house, The concept was to have the Mill on the side power the house for its electrical and heating needs, it was designed with the Ottawa River in mind.

While designing this house I felt it was important to accomodate for a net-zero footprint accomodating for this with solar panels on the roof and sides and a wheel. Environmentalisam is something I hope to continue as a focal point in my projects to come. Also essential to include plenty of storage seeing as the living area is restricted so heavily in tiny house design. I emphasiszed these needs for the consumer with the storage accounted for throughout. In tiny house design it can often be problematic to find a living area that suits the needs of daily life, I wanted to emphasise relaxation with clean lined space. 

In this repository you will find the Revit files and renderd images of my tiny house.
